This directory contains solutions to all four questions:
1. question1.cpp - Creates an adjacency list for an undirected graph.
2. question2.cpp - Performs Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal of a graph.
3. question3.cpp - Performs Depth First Search (DFS) traversal of a graph.
4. question4.cpp - Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) weight using Prim's algorithm.

Special Instructions:
- Each program is tested with custom inputs.
- The outputs are displayed on the console.
